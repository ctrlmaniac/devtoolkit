# .shellcheckrc for the webnodex project
# Place this file in the root of your project (e.g., ~/webnodex/.shellcheckrc)

# Set the default shell for scripts in this project to bash.
# This is useful if your scripts don't always have a shebang or if you want
# to enforce a specific dialect for checking.
shell=bash

# Instruct ShellCheck to include the directory of the script being checked (SCRIPTDIR)
# in its search path for sourced files.
# This is generally the default behavior for direct relative paths (e.g., 'source ../lib.sh').
# It complements in-script '# shellcheck source=' directives, which are crucial
# when you source files using variables (e.g., 'source "$LIB_PATH"').
source-path=SCRIPTDIR

# For SC1091 ("file not found") errors with your current setup:
# - The in-script directives like '# shellcheck source=../utils/check-install.sh'
#   are correctly guiding ShellCheck for variable-based sourcing.
# - The most common reason for persistent SC1091 errors, even with correct directives,
#   is that the target file (e.g., 'utils/check-install.sh')
#   *does not actually exist* at that path when ShellCheck is run.

# Example: To disable a check globally (use with caution; inline is often better for clarity):
# disable=SC2034 # If you had many scripts with intentionally unused variables for external tools.
