To properly assess your project and guide you toward a robust and scalable solution, here’s how I’ll proceed:

1. **Initial Evaluation of Your Repository**: I will review [your GitHub repo](https://github.com/ctrlmaniac/devtoolkit/tree/main) to understand the current state of the code, structure, and goals.
2. **Define a Clean Starting Plan**: You want to build a **bootstrapping CLI** that evolves into a **Node.js full-stack toolkit**, eventually hosted in an **Nx workspace**.
3. **Recommend Technologies & Setup Plan**: Since your script must run on fresh WSL/Ubuntu instances, the initial bootstrapping must use a language shipped by default on Ubuntu. Then, we’ll pivot to Node.js once installed.

## ✅ Repository Review Summary

Your current repo has the following characteristics:

* It uses **bash scripts**, e.g., `devtoolkit`, for handling install routines.
* The logic is **modular but fragmented**, and lacks structure for scaling into a true CLI.
* Scripts are not yet idempotent or robust enough to manage different install states.
* There is no clear package/module structure.
* No test coverage or logging mechanism.

This is a good prototype, but needs a proper architecture.

## 🧱 Recommended Architecture & Tech Stack

Here’s a plan that meets your requirements:

### **Phase 1: Bootstrap CLI in Shell (default-installed language)**

Language: **POSIX Shell / Bash**

Purpose:

* Detect platform (WSL/Ubuntu native)
* Install `curl`, `wget`, `git`, and **Node.js (via nvm or volta)**
* Once Node.js is ready, pivot to JavaScript/TypeScript CLI

> ✅ Ubuntu ships with `bash`, `curl`, `wget`, and `git`—this guarantees compatibility.

### **Phase 2: Self-Upgrading Node.js CLI**

Language: **TypeScript (Node.js)**
Package Manager: `pnpm` or `npm`
Distribution: `npx` + optional `pkg` (to package as a binary)

Purpose:

* Offer rich UX (prompts, selection lists, etc.) using libraries like:

  * `inquirer`
  * `chalk`
  * `ora`
* Manage:

  * Project scaffolding
  * Tooling installation
  * Linting and formatting setup
  * Git hooks
  * Nx plugin configuration

## 📁 Clean Nx-Based Monorepo Setup Plan

Run the following to get started from scratch:

```bash
npx create-nx-workspace@latest devtoolkit
```

Choose:

* Workspace layout: `integrated`
* Package manager: your choice (`pnpm` preferred)

This gives you a clean monorepo ready to host multiple CLI tools and libraries.

### Suggested Nx Project Structure

```

├── apps/
│   └── cli/               # Node.js CLI entry point
├── packages/
│   ├── core/              # Shared logic (tool detection, OS detection, etc.)

## ✅ Next Steps

Here’s a step-by-step teaching plan tailored to your case.

/teach "Creating a shell-to-node.js bootstrapping CLI using Nx"

This will walk you through:

1. Designing the minimal shell bootstrapper.
2. Writing a Node.js CLI with inquirer.
3. Nx workspace setup and configuration.
4. Scaffolding and plugin integration.

Would you like to start with the bootstrapping script structure first?
